1. FEM_hyperelastic_orginal_converted_code.py 
- Original converted code of hyperealsticity

----
Could delete below 2 if running simulation from other location is not mendatory

2. FEM_hyperelastic (WIP) 
- Trying to run simulation from other folder

3. FEM_hyperelastic_v01 (WIP)
- Trying to run simulation from other folder
- This code imports the Giraffe_run.py file, which need to copy to Giraffe.exe folder

----

4. FEM_hyperelastic_v02 (Working)
- Need to copy FEM_hyperelastic_v02.py along with data folder in location of Giraffe.exe for execution

5. FEM_hyperelastic_v03 (WIP)
- Added function calling inside loop

6. FEM_hyperelastic_v04 (WIP)
- Copy of FEM_hyperelastic_orginal_converted_code.py 
- Replace for and while loop for better speed
